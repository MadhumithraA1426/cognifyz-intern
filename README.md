# Task 1: HTML Structure and Basic Server

## Objective
To understand server-side rendering and form handling using Node.js and Express.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS

## Description
This task demonstrates a basic Express server that handles form submissions and dynamically renders HTML using EJS.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
npm install
2. Start server:
node server.js
3. Open browser:
http://localhost:3000


# Task 2: Inline Styles, Basic Interaction, and Server-Side Validation

## Objective
To enhance form handling by adding client-side interaction, server-side validation, and temporary data storage.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- Inline CSS
- Inline JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS

## Description
This task extends the basic form functionality by implementing inline styles for layout and appearance.  
Client-side validation is performed using JavaScript to improve user experience, while server-side validation ensures data integrity and security.  
Validated user data is stored temporarily in server memory.

## Features
- Multi-field user input form
- Client-side validation using JavaScript
- Server-side validation using Express
- Temporary server-side data storage (in-memory)
- Dynamic feedback messages

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
    npm install
2. Start the server:
    node server.js
3. Open in browser:
    http://localhost:3000
